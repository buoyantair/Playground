What Happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- git creates a repository and starts tracking changes made to the files.
 This will ensure that the files are being tracked by git.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 - It will help us differentiate between what files we edited.
